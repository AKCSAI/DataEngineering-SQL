Data Engineering Toolkit â€“ a collection of practical, plug-and-play scripts and utilities built to support common data engineering tasks. 
Whether you're handling data ingestion, transformation, or pipeline automation, this repository is designed to accelerate your workflow with minimal setup.

How to Use: Clone this repository to your local environment:

Copy code (bash):

git clone https://github.com/AKCSAI/DataEngineering-SQL.git

Step 1 - Convert the CSV file to SQL (The python code is available in Python-Cybersecurity)

Step 2 - Run sqlite3 .db

Step 3 - The code for this is available in the SQL file. I've made it into a comment just copy and paste.

Step 4 - Run .read .sql

Step 5 - Test by typing .tables

Step 6 - See all data is there SELECT * FROM

Ensure that the paths to any external files or resources are correctly set in your environment or scripts. Execute the SQL scripts as per the comments or documentation included in each file.

Requirements: Make sure you have the required database setup and permissions to run these scripts. Double-check the file paths to external resources if applicable.
