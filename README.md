Data Engineering Toolkit – a collection of practical, plug-and-play scripts and utilities built to support common data engineering tasks. 
Whether you're handling data ingestion, transformation, or pipeline automation, this repository is designed to accelerate your workflow with minimal setup.

How to Use: Clone this repository to your local environment:

Copy code (bash):

git clone https://github.com/AKCSAI/DataEngineering-SQL.git

Step 1 - Convert the CSV file to SQL (The python code is available in Python-Cybersecurity)

Step 2 - Run sqlite3 (any-name-you-want).db

Step 3 - The code for this is available in the SQL file. I've made it into a comment just copy and paste.

NOTE: Make sure to remove the first number column in your CSV before conversion, or you'll get an error.

Step 4 - .read (filename).sql

Step 5 - .tables (Test by typing just like that)

Step 6 - See all data is there SELECT * FROM (tablename);

Ensure that the paths to any external files or resources are correctly set in your environment or scripts. Execute the SQL scripts as per the comments or documentation included in each file.

Requirements: Make sure you have the required database setup and permissions to run these scripts. Double-check the file paths to external resources if applicable.

Notes: If you run into issues, verify file paths and database permissions for smooth execution. Feel free to submit issues, contribute, or ask questions!
